Hi, I'm Alston! I am currently pursuing my Bachelor in Computer Science at the *University of Waterloo*. At the moment, the field I am most interested in is *Machine Learning* and *Artificial Intelligence*, and have worked on a number of AI projects that have enhanced my knowledge of the same. Outside of coding, I enjoy *watching science fiction movies*, *reading self help books*, *running* and *playing cricket*.
