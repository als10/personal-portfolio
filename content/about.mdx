Hi, I'm Alston! I am currently pursuing my Bachelor in Computer Science at the *University of Waterloo*. Thanks to my projects and internships, I would say I am most experienced in mobile and web development. However, I am interested in *Machine Learning* and *Artificial Intelligence*, and I try to learn a bit more about the field every day. Outside of coding, I enjoy *watching science fiction movies*, *reading novels*, *running* and *playing cricket*.
